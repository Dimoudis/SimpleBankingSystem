# Simple Banking System

This is a simple Java banking system project that demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts.

## Overview

- Implemented an abstract class `Account` with common fields like `balance` and `accountNumber`.
- Created two subclasses: `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`, each with their own implementations of the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods.
- Used polymorphism and method overriding to allow each account type to handle transactions differently.
- Included a simple console menu in the `Main` class for the user to:
  1. Deposit to an account
  2. Withdraw from an account
  3. Show account balances
  4. Exit the program
- Demonstrates basic use of `Scanner` for user input and simple conditional logic.

## Key Concepts

- Abstract classes and abstract methods
- Method overriding (`@Override`)
- Polymorphism
- Basic console input/output
- Simple object-oriented design
